# Advanced Keylogger Detection Tool

üîí A Python-based cybersecurity project to detect keyloggers, built to deepen my malware analysis skills. Tested ethically on my own system for educational purposes only.

## Overview
This tool detects keyloggers by monitoring processes, files, network activity, and file modifications. It features a sleek console interface, desktop notifications, and interactive threat mitigation, making it both functional and professional.

## Features
- üîç **Process Monitoring**: Detects suspicious Python processes using `pynput` or `keyboard` with `psutil`.
- üìÇ **File Scanning**: Finds keylogger files (e.g., `keylog.txt`, `server_log.txt`).
- üåê **Network Monitoring**: Identifies potential data exfiltration connections.
- üîî **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends desktop notifications via `plyer`.
- üìä **Visual Output**: Displays results in colorful tables using `rich`.
- üìú **JSON Logging**: Saves findings to `detection_log.json` for analysis.
- ‚ö° **Interactive Actions**: Prompts to terminate processes or delete files.

## How It Works
1. **Keylogger (keylogger.py)**: A test keylogger (for learning) logs keystrokes to `keylog.txt` and simulates data transmission to `server_log.txt`. Stops with `Esc` key.
2. **Detector (advanced_keylogger_detector.py)**: Scans for:
   - Processes using `pynput` (e.g., `keylogger.py`).
   - Suspicious files and recent modifications.
   - Active network connections.
3. Outputs findings in console tables, notifications, and JSON logs, with options to terminate threats.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

Install dependencies:
bashpip install psutil rich plyer

Run the detector:
bashpython advanced_keylogger_detector.py

(Optional) Run the test keylogger to simulate threats:
bashpython keylogger.py


Usage

Run keylogger.py in one terminal (VS Code) to simulate a keylogger.
Run advanced_keylogger_detector.py in another terminal.
Watch for colorful tables, notifications, and prompts to terminate processes or delete files.
Stop with Ctrl+C (detector) or Esc (keylogger).
Check detection_log.json for structured logs.

Example Output
json{"timestamp": "2025-08-01T15:17:00", "level": "INFO", "message": "Suspicious file found: ./keylog.txt"}
Console table:
text+--------------+------------------+
| File Path    | Action           |
+--------------+------------------+
| ./keylog.txt | Prompt to delete |
+--------------+------------------+
Ethical Note
This project is for educational purposes only, tested on my own system/virtual machine. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always obtain consent before monitoring systems.
Future Enhancements

Add a GUI with tkinter for a desktop app experience.
Generate reports from JSON logs.
Expand network analysis for specific protocols (e.g., SMTP).
